Routing automation between components ports
===================================================

``fp.Linked``, a functional module for port routing automation, is included in **PhotoCAD**. This module automates the routing of components in a layout by defining port connections in a Python script. For ports that require waveguide transition, the tool automatically selects the appropriate waveguide transition unit to convert the different waveguide types. After running the script file, a local folder is created to store the generated GDS, netlist, etc.


Linked
^^^^^^^^^
``Linked``, a functional module for port routing automation, is included in **PhotoCAD**. This module automates the routing of devices in a layout by defining port linking relationships in a Python script. For ports that require waveguide transition, the tool automatically selects the appropriate waveguide transition unit to convert the different waveguide types. After running the script file, a local folder is created to store the generated GDS, netlist, etc.

This example uses a script to place several different types of waveguides, set the connection relationship between waveguide ports, and achieve automatic routing of different types of waveguides through ``Linked`` in **PhotoCAD**.

Section Script Description
--------------------------------

#. Import the functional modules and the gpdk package::

        from dataclasses import dataclass
        from fnpcell import all as fp
        from gpdk import all as pdk
        from gpdk.technology import get_technology
        from gpdk.technology.waveguide_factory import EulerBendFactory

#. Define class ``Linked``::


        class Linked(fp.PCell):


#. Define build function to generate components

   #. Parameters correspond to instances, graphics, and ports in the function module::

        def build(self):
            insts, elems, ports = super().build()


   #. Implemented the waveguide used to connect the component ports in the function using the ``get_technology()`` module in ``gpdk``::

        TECH = get_technology()

   #. The ``SBend`` module in ``gpdk`` creates an S-shaped bend which is an Euler Bend, where parameters such as ``distance``, ``height``, ``waveguide_type`` and ``bend_factory`` control the lateral distance of the two ports, the vertical distance of the two ports,  waveguide type and the process of the bend, respectively. Parameters such as ``radius_min``, ``l_max`` and ``waveguide_type`` control the process of the generated ``EulerBend``::

            sbend = pdk.SBend(distance=100, height=-90, waveguide_type=TECH.WG.FWG.C.WIRE, bend_factory=EulerBendFactory(radius_min=15, l_max=35, waveguide_type=TECH.WG.FWG.C.WIRE))

   #. Define four different types of straight waveguides through the ``Straight`` module in ``gpdk``, with the parameters ``length`` and ``waveguide_type`` controlling the length and type of the straight waveguide, respectively::

            straight_fw = pdk.Straight(length=5, waveguide_type=TECH.WG.FWG.C.WIRE)
            straight_fe = pdk.Straight(length=5, waveguide_type=TECH.WG.FWG.C.EXPANDED)
            straight_mw = pdk.Straight(length=5, waveguide_type=TECH.WG.MWG.C.WIRE)
            straight_sw = pdk.Straight(length=5, waveguide_type=TECH.WG.SWG.C.WIRE)

   #. Create six different devices from each of the four different types of waveguides defined below, and control the position of the device by the ``translated(x,y)`` method; control the rotation angle of the device by the ``rotated(degrees=n)`` method ::

            sb10 = sbend.translated(-200, 0)
            s10 = straight_fw
            s15 = straight_fe.translated(100, 0)
            s20 = straight_sw.translated(200, 0)
            s30 = straight_mw.rotated(degrees=30).translated(300, 100)
            s40 = straight_fw.rotated(degrees=30).translated(50, 100)

   #. Define the connection relationship between the ports by calling the ``fp.Linked`` module to achieve automatic routing and combine all waveguides used for device port connection as ``device``. For example, ``sb10["op_1"] <= s10["op_0"]`` defines that the ``op_0`` port of device ``s10`` is connected to the ``op_1`` port of ``sb10``. The completed device has only two ports, ``op_0`` of ``sb10`` and ``op_1`` of ``s40``::


            device = fp.Linked(
                link_type=TECH.WG.SWG.C.EXPANDED,
                bend_factory=TECH.WG.FWG.C.WIRE.BEND_EULER, #bend_factory,
                links=[
                    sb10["op_1"] >> s10["op_0"],
                    s10["op_1"] >> s15["op_0"],
                    s15["op_1"] >> s20["op_0"],
                    s20["op_1"] >> s30["op_0"],
                    s30["op_1"] >> s40["op_0"],
                ],
                ports=[sb10["op_0"], s40["op_1"]],
            )

   #. Instantiate ``device``::

            insts += device

   #. Returns the instance, element and port of the generated device::

        return insts, elems, ports



   #. Create layout units using class ``Linked``::

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            from gpdk.util.path import local_output_file

            gds_file = local_output_file(__file__).with_suffix(".gds")
            library = fp.Library()

            TECH = get_technology()
            # =============================================================
            # fmt: off

            library += Linked()

            # fmt: on
            # =============================================================
            fp.export_gds(library, file=gds_file)
            # fp.plot(library)

#. Export GDS Layout

   #.

           * ``Linked``: Top Level Layout Unit
           * ``Linked_x1``: Subunits of ``Linked``, containing ``Linked_links`` and other component modules.
           * ``Linked_links``ï¼šAutomatically generated combinations of waveguides connecting ports of various types of components.
           * ``SBend``: ``Eulerbend`` of the generated S-shape defined in the script.
           * ``Straight*``: Define the generated ``Straight`` waveguide in the script.

                .. image:: ../images/example_linked1.png


   #. The ``Linked_links`` in the Cells list is a collection of waveguides automatically generated under the ``Linked`` function. Double-click on the ``Linked_links`` to hide them, and you can see in the layout the S-shaped ``EulerBend`` and the five straight waveguide shapes placed by the script, whose positions are realized in the script by ``.translate()``.

            .. image:: ../images/example_linked2.png

   #. Double-click ``Linked_links`` again to display it, and you can see that the connection waveguide generated by the script is adapted according to the port waveguide type, and the bend is automatically selected according to the port direction and angle to adjust the waveguide direction.

AutoTransitioned
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case that the device ports need to connect to different types of waveguides, the ``AutoTransitioned`` method can be used to implement the transition of the component ports, and the specific schematic of this function is given in ``gpdk`` > ``routing`` > ``auto_transitioned`` > ``auto_transitioned.py``, and the core usage is as follows ::

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            from gpdk.util.path import local_output_file

            gds_file = local_output_file(__file__).with_suffix(".gds")
            library = fp.Library()

            TECH = get_technology()
            # =============================================================
            # fmt: off
            from gpdk.components.mmi.mmi import Mmi

            library += AutoTransitioned(device=Mmi(waveguide_type=TECH.WG.FWG.C.WIRE), waveguide_types={"*": TECH.WG.SWG.C.WIRE})

            # fmt: on
            # =============================================================
            fp.export_gds(library, file=gds_file)
            # fp.plot(library)

Here, different waveguide types of component ports are connected by using the ``AutoTransitioned`` class, where the parameter ``device`` is used to receive the components whose ports need to be automatically converted; ``waveguide_types`` receives the waveguide types of the converted ports, where ``*: TECH.WG.SWG.C.WIRE`` is a key-value pair and ``*`` refers to all undefined ports. Finally we can get the following device after port auto-transition.
