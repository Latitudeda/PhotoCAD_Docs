PhotoCAD User Manual
====================================
**PhotoCAD** is written in Python, a language widely used in the photonics industry, and the algorithms used to generate the layout are carefully optimized and researched by the developers, giving it a unique advantage over similar tools at home and abroad, such as no distortion or tearing of the layout at any angle. **fnpcell** and **link** are the two main tools of **PhotoCAD**, which correspond to the parametric cell layout and circuit-level layout in photonics chip layout design.

For beginners who wants to create a PIC by themselves by using **PhotoCAD**, we recommend to look through the ``Guides`` section, and you can get a quick glimpse from creating PCells to building your own circuits.

There are also several applications created by **Latitudeda** in the ``EXAMPLES`` section, users could also browse the examples to get an imagination how can **PhotoCAD** realize your ideas.
