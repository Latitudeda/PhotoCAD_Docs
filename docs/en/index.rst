PhotoCAD User Manual
====================================
**PhotoCAD** is a Python-based computer-aided design platform for photonics chip layout design. **fnpcell** and **link** are the two main tools of **PhotoCAD**, which correspond to the parametric cell layout and circuit-level layout in photonics chip layout design.

**PhotoCAD** is written in Python, a language widely used in the photonics industry, and the algorithms used to generate the layout are carefully optimized and researched by the developers, giving it a unique advantage over similar tools at home and abroad, such as no distortion or tearing of the layout at any angle.
