technology
===================================

File ``technology`` mainly stores some scripts related to the underlying layer.
The following is an introduction through the parts that will be used frequently.

- :ref:`layers.csv`
- :ref:`generate layers and display from csv file.py`
- layers.py
- display.py
- :ref:`waveguide_factory.py`
- :ref:`wg.py`
- :ref:`auto_link.py`
- :ref:`auto_transition.py`

The file ``layers.csv`` is a user configuration file, and the user-configured csv file can be automatically converted into ``layers.py`` and ``display.py`` files by the file ``generate_layers_and_display_from_csv.py``.
