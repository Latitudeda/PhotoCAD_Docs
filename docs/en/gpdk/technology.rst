technology
===================================

File ``technology`` mainly stores some scripts related to the underlying layer.
The following is an introduction through the parts that will be used frequently. We recommend users follow the below order to configure their own ``technology`` settings.

1. :ref:`layers.csv`
2. :ref:`waveguide_factory.py`
3. :ref:`wg.py`
4. :ref:`auto_transition.py`
5. :ref:``auto_link.py``
6. :ref:``linker.py``


The file ``layers.csv`` is a user configuration file, and the user-configured csv file can be automatically converted into ``layers.py`` and ``display.py`` files by the file ``generate_layers_and_display_from_csv.py``.
