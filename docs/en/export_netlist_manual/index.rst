Exporting Netlist in PhotoCAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**PhotoCAD** can export the SPICE format netlist while completing the layout design by scripting. 

The content described in the netlist is consistent with the physical design in the layout, and the device modules in the layout correspond to the sub-modules in the netlist, and the device ports in the layout appear as module ports (or circuit nodes) in the netlist. 

The optical simulator can read the netlist to realize circuit-level simulation. Moreover, for the design of electronic-photonic hybrid chips, it is also easier to realize the electronic-photonic hybrid simulation corresponding to it through the netlist in SPICE format.
