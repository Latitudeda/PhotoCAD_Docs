Simplify layout by ``use_sketch_view``
==============================================================================

* Useful when generating large area of layout but only want to focus on the connections between ports rather than the cell itself.

* Write ``fp.use_sketch_view(device, sketch_layer, conf)`` before exporting GDS file.

* For more information please see section Sketch view of PCells.
