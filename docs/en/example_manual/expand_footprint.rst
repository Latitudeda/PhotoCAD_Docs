Expand the footprint for downstream devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In photonic circuit layout design, there are often scenarios where space needs to be expanded for downstream device placement and connection. For example, ``DirectionalCoupler`` is often used for optical signal distribution, where the optical signal is passed through the waveguide to the downstream devices.

**PhotoCAD** includes tools to expand the layout space for downstream devices, enabling the design of optical signals to be assigned to downstream device layouts via ``DirectionalCoupler``.
