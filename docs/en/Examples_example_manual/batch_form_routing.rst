Routing in batch form
===============================================

**PhotoCAD** has a built-in layout and routing tool in batch form that can be used for modular layout design with similar components, and is often used to quickly generate components or modules in a test chip in batch. 

In a test chip, the devices or modules to be verified usually have similar connection relationships, and the devices or modules are placed in a certain pattern to better match the probes for testing.
