Adding ``@dataclass`` in the beginning of every PCell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As from Python 3.7, ``dataclasses`` has been added to the features to provide a way to create data classes in a simpler manner without the need to write methods.

See below figures of the changes when adding ``@dataclass`` or not. Although it does not cause any issue to not adding the decorator, we highly recommend adding because it helps the user check details written in the PCell. An over-simplified version of PCell class definition is not good for typing checker.
